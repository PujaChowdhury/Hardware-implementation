# Dataset-1-Quad-PCB-Shock-Loading

This dataset contains the measured acceleration data for an electronics unit under shock test. Figure 1 shows the electronics unit which consists of four circuit boards with high-g Meggitt 72 accelerometers mounted on each. The units for the accelerometers are in kg<sub>n</sub> and are sampled at 1 MS/s. The Meggitt 72 high-g accelerometers are able to accurately measure accelerations of 120,000 g<sub>n</sub> or 120 kg<sub>n</sub>, where 1 g<sub>n</sub> = 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup> = 32.2 ft/s<sup>2</sup>. The electronics are potted in the canister with potting material to secure all parts in place.

The test specimen is subjected to 5 repeated tests where slight variations in the signal are observed, presumably caused by damage in the PCBs. Figure 2 shows the deceleration profile from three different tests for a single accelerometer.
